Backend engineer with 8+ years of experience building production-ready APIs, designing scalable databases, and developing systems that focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability. Most of my work revolves around backend API development, database architecture, and exploring how AI and LLMs can streamline modern engineering workflows.

I focus on writing clean, predictable code and designing systems that grow smoothly as the product grows. I care about developer experience, consistency in architecture, and making sure every service is easy for the next engineer to understand.

## What I Work With
- Node.js and PHP (Laravel) for building backend services
- Microservices architecture and REST API design
- Serverless cloud applications and event-driven workflows
- Secure authentication systems (JWT, OAuth2, SSO)
- Creating internal tools, automation scripts, and reusable backend components
- Improving performance, reducing complexity, and increasing reliability

## Databases I Use
- **Relational:** PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **NoSQL:** MongoDB, DynamoDB  
- **In-Memory & Cache:** Redis, Memcached  

I’m always open to collaboration, technical discussions, or helping solve backend architecture problems. If you’re working on something interesting or want to share ideas, feel free to connect on ram@devcentrehouse.eu.
